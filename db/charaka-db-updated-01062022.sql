It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as preserves, fruit juice, pies, ice creams, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry aroma is also widely used in many industrial food products. As strawberry flavor and fragrance are popular characteristics for consumers,they are used widely in a variety of manufacturing, including foods, beverages, confections, perfumes and cosmetics. Sweetness, fragrance and complex flavor are favorable attributes. In plant breeding and farming, emphasis is placed on sugars, acids, and volatile compounds, which improve the taste and fragrance of a ripe strawberry.

Dates are oval-cylindrical, 3?7 cm long, and 2?3 cm (0.79?1.18 in) diameter, and when ripe, range from bright red to bright yellow in colour, depending on variety. Dates contain a single stone about 2?2.5 cm (0.79?0.98 in) long and 6?8 mm (0.24?0.31 in) thick. Three main cultivar groups of date exist: soft (e.g. \'Barhee\', \'Halawy\', \'Khadrawy\', \'Medjool\'), semi-dry (e.g. \'Dayri\', \'Deglet Noor\', \'Zahdi\'), and dry (e.g. \'Thoory\').
